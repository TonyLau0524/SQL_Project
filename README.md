##  Introduction
In this project, DVD rental data give a lot of insight to the business and we are going to use SQL querying techniques we have learnt from CanTek to explore and manipulate the data.The DVD rental database dataset can be found from [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/)


## Tool
 - PostgreSQL (version 16)
 - pgAdmin 4 (version 7.7)
 - Git (version 2.37.1)

## SQL analysis of DVD rental database

**Query_01: Actor whose first name start with A **

    select count(*) as number_of_actor_whose_first_name_start_with_A from actor
    where first_name ilike 'A%'

This query retrieved the number of actor whose first name start with A.

**Query_02: The film rating**

    select rating, count(*) as number_of_films from film
    group by rating
    order by count(*) desc

This query retrieved which the film rating is the most in the film .

**Query_03: Top rental customer**

    select first_name, last_name ,count(*)  as number_of_rental,country from customer as c
    join rental as r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    join address as a on c.address_id = a.address_id
    join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
    join country on city.country_id = country.country_id
    group by c.customer_id ,country
    order by count(*) desc, first_name
    limit 10;

This query retrieved which customers rent the most film DVD in the store. by using Inner Join the country data, It gives the nationality of the customers.

**Query_04: Top rental country**

    select country, count(*)  as number_of_rental from customer as c
    join rental as r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    join address as a on c.address_id = a.address_id
    join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
    join country on city.country_id = country.country_id
    group by country
    order by count(*) desc
    limit 10;

This query retrieved which countries rent the most film DVD in the store. This result tells us the target audience from.

**Query_05: The median **

    select
    (
	     (select max(length) from (SELECT  length from film order by length limit 500))
    + (select min(length) from (SELECT  length from film order by length desc limit 500))
	       )/2 as length_median

This query retrieved the median of the film lengths. There is no MEDIAN() function in SQL Server but we still can work it out.

**Query_06: Short or Long film? **

    With duration_table as(SELECT *,
    case 
    when length <60 then 'under 60mins'
    when length >=60 and length<90 then '60 - 90mins'
    when length >=90 and length<120 then '90 - 120mins'
    else 'more than 120 mins'
    end as film_duration

    from film as f
    join inventory as i on f.film_id = i.film_id
    join rental as r on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id)

    select film_duration,count(*) as number_of_rental

## SQL analysis of DVD rental database

    FROM film
    WHERE replacement_cost > 20
    ORDER BY replacement_cost DESC

This query retrieved which film's replacement cost was larger than $20 with the film ID, film title, and the replacement cost. The table is in descending order by the replacement cost of the film. In this query, comparison operator '>' is used to compare the replacement cost of each film which larger than $20.

**Query_02: Logical operator**

    SELECT staff_id, first_name, last_name, active
    FROM staff
    WHERE active in (true)

This query retrieved which staff is currently working in the DVD store with the staff ID, staff's first name, last name, and their active status. In this query, the logical operator "IN" is used to check whether the staff's active status is true or not.
